You are provided with the following:
1) MongoDB collection (JSON file) which you can import to your local DB via MongoDB
Compass. The collection has exactly 500 documents containing data points for NIFTY 500
Stocks. The following fields are available:
a) stock_fincode – A unique fincode assigned to every company.
b) stock_name – Complete name of the company.
c) stock_symbol – Unique Symbol name of the company.

Require parameter: ‘entry’
Possible values of param: ‘old’ & ‘new’
Example query:
https://alphabet.researchandranking.com/assignment/stockData?entry=old
This API provides you Open, Close, High, Low & Volume values for two different dates for
over 3000 stocks.
Your Task:
Create a program to fetch both – Old & New stock price- values from the API.
Calculate the Performance & Volume % Change between Old & New entries ONLY for the
stocks available in your MongoDB collection.
Furthermore, the program should create an excel file – containing 500 rows (for every stock in
stock_list collection) along with the following details:
1) Symbol
2) Entry Price (‘close’ from ‘old’ data dump)
3) Exit Price (‘close’ from ‘new’ data dump)
4) Performance
5) Volume % Change

Make sure the excel sheet is sorted by ‘Symbol’ in ascending order.
